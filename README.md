# MNIST Digit Classifier

This is a basic neural network I built using TensorFlow and Keras that can recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It's a small project I did to learn more about how machine learning models work.

---

## What It Does

- Loads and normalizes image data from MNIST (0â€“9 digits)
- Trains a neural network with one hidden layer and dropout
- Uses softmax to output probabilities for each digit
- Predicts test images and shows how confident the model is

---

## Tech Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- matplotlib (optional for graphs)

---

## How to Run It

You can open the notebook directly in Google Colab or run it locally if you have the required libraries.

```python
Google Colab (recommended)

## Personal experince
Machine learning was always part of computer sceince that i only knew in theory, and making a model myslef is a very lifechanging moment, because buildig something new yourself is the best feeling in the world, i hope that in future i will bbe able to do much harder projects
